# Ariane 5 Failure – Programming and Integer Overflow
This educational module uses the real-life failure of the Ariane 5 rocket to teach programming fundamentals. The goal is to demonstrate how even basic coding mistakes—like mishandling data types—can have catastrophic consequences in real-world engineering systems.

**NOTE**: This mini-lecture is designed to last approximately 45–60 minutes. It is intended as a guided, instructor-led session and is not fully interactive, though the exercises and final simulation can be explored individually.

## Learning Objectives

1. LO1: Students recognize and apply primitive data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans in Python.

2. LO2: Students perform basic operations with these data types and understand how they relate to physical phenomena like velocity and acceleration.

3. LO3: Students understand what functions are, how to define them, and how to use them in basic simulations.

4. LO4: Students grasp the concept of integer overflow and its real-world implications.

5. LO5: Students observe how overflow affects a rocket’s behavior in a simulated animation.

## Methods of Teaching

This session combines:
- Short theoretical explanations embedded within a Jupyter Notebook.
- Coding demonstrations and student exercises related to rockets and space missions.
- A final simulation that visually illustrates the Ariane 5 failure due to an overflow error.

The lesson is best delivered as a live demonstration with occasional audience engagement (e.g. answering questions about code behavior or predicting outcomes).
